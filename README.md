# Data-Processing-And-Lookup-Tool
The project is designed to compile data fed to the program to process, sort, and present records of inventory items.
The project imports an initial third party data "basefile.txt" allowing for the following data manipulation processes:
 1. Sort By: Name/Price/Quantity.
 2. Element: Insert/Modify/Remove.
 3. Search Element.
 4. Import and Merge File.
 5. Check for Duplicates.
 6. Output Records on File.

Additional work underway:
 1. Integrate Newegg-GPU-Webscraping-Tool into Data-Processing-And-Lookup-Tool functionality.
 2. Split receipt based on product keywords. (by RTX 3070, for example)
 3. Remove all records of receipt above X price.
 4. Update shared CSV between Newegg-GPU-Webscraping-Tool and Data-Processing-And-Lookup-Tool functionality.
