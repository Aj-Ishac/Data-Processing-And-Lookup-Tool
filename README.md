# Data-Processing-And-Lookup-Tool
The project is designed to compile data fed to the program to process, sort, and present records of inventory items.
The project imports an initial third party data "basefile.txt" allowing for the following data manipulation processes:
 1. Sort By: Name/Price/Quantity
 2. Element: Insert/Modify/Remove
 3. Search Element
 4. Import and Merge File
 5. Check for Duplicates
 6. Output Records on File

Work in progress:  
 1. Split receipt based on product keywords  
 2. Connectivity to the wip python-based user-input webscraper  
 3. Interactive GUI  
 4. Export to CSV
