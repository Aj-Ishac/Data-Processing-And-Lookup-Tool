# Data-Processing-And-Lookup-Tool
The project is designed to compile data fed to the program to process, sort, and present records of inventory items.
The project imports an initial third party data "basefile.txt" allowing for the following data manipulation processes:
 1. Sort By: Name/Price/Quantity.
 2. Element: Insert/Modify/Remove.
 3. Search Element.
 4. Import and Merge File.
 5. Check for Duplicates.
 6. Output Records on File.

Work in progress:  
 1. Split receipt based on product keywords.
 2. Seamless communication with the WIP Price-Webscraping-Tool
 3. Simplify data presented to the user for quick purchase decision making.
 4. Interactive GUI.
 5. Export to CSV.
